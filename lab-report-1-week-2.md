Above is the image if opening my VSCode application as I have already installed it for using during CSE11. Therefore, I didn't install VSCOde for this class, but when I did, all I had to do was do to the VSCode website and download to install.

Here, I am remotely connecting. At first I did have trouble due to the nature of VSCode and UCSD's passwords system not updating. Eventually though, the thing that helped was waiting, as resetting the password of the UCSD account can take up to 20 minutes to update, of which after I did, worked very efficiently.
